**Date:** \
Tuesday May 2, 2023

**Time:** \
2pm–5pm

**Instructor:** \
Marie-Hélène Burle (Simon Fraser University)

**Prerequisites:** \
Basic knowledge of R and some basic working knowledge of HPC (how to submit Slurm jobs and view their output).

**Software:** \
We will provide access to one of our Linux systems. To make use of it, attendees will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on their computer. On Windows we recommend the [free Home Edition of MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html). On Mac and Linux computers, SSH is usually pre-installed (try typing `ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there).
