title: Parallel R
description: |
  R is not famous for its speed. With code optimization and parallelization, it can however be used for heavy computations. This course will introduce you to working with R from the command line on the Alliance clusters with a focus on performance. We will discuss code profiling and benchmarking, various parallelization techniques, as well as using C++ from inside R to speed up calculations.

**Date:** \
Tuesday May 2, 2023

**Time:** \
2pm–5pm

**Instructor:** \
Marie-Hélène Burle (Simon Fraser University)

**Prerequisites:** \
Basic knowledge of R and some basic working knowledge of HPC (how to submit Slurm jobs and view their output).

**Software:** \
We will provide access to one of our Linux systems. To make use of it, attendees will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on their computer. On Windows we recommend the [free Home Edition of MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html). On Mac and Linux computers, SSH is usually pre-installed (try typing `ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there).
